吾十有五而志于学，三十而立，四十而不惑，五十而知天命，六十而耳顺，七十而从心所欲，不逾矩。

:   At fifteen I set my heart upon learning. At thirty, I planted my feet firm upon
    the ground. At forty, I no longer suffered from perplexities. At fifty, I knew
    what were the biddings of Heaven. At sixty,I heard them with docile ear. At
    seventy, I could follow the dictates of my own heart; for what I desired no
    longer overstepped the boundaries of right.

不患人之不己知，患不知人也。

:   I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do
    not know men.
